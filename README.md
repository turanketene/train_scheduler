# Train Scheduler

Deployed @ https://turanketene.github.io/train_scheduler/

## Description
In this assignment, we are creating a train schedule application that uses firebase to store data. Users will input the train name, destination, start time, and frequency. By also using moment.js, we are able to calculate when the next train will arrive. Storing on firebase allows the data to be persistent, meaning the information entered will be stored and shown even when the page is refreshed.
